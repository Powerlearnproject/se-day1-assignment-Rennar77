Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and ,maitenace of high quality software systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Operating systems
Web applications 
Mobile Apps

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
Design: Creating a high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach where  each phase must be completed before the next begins
waterfall methodology is used when projects requirements are well-defined, understood and unlikely to change.
On the other hand agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach where the project is divided into small, manageable units called sprints or iterations.
Agile is ideal for projects where requirements are expected to change or are not fully understood at the outset.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software suits that provide comprehensiv tools for writing, debugging and testing code. They include intellij IDEA, Visual studio and also eclipse
VCs are software tools ment for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. They include Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements this may lead to project delays
Tight deadlines this can result in rushed development and compromised quality
these challenges can be overcome by effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassesment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing individual components or units of the software in isolation to ensure they function correctly.
Unit testing helps catch bugs at the earliest stage of development, where they are often easier and cheaper to fix
Integration testing involves testing the interactions between different units or components of the software.
Integration testing helps identify problems that might not be apparent when units are tested in isolation, such as issues with how modules communicate or pass data.
System testing involves testing the entire system as a whole, ensuring that all components work together in the complete, integrated application.
System testing validates the end-to-end flow of the application, ensuring that all aspects of the system work together to meet the overall requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
Prompt engineering helps avoid that by making our questions clear and specific so the AI understands exactly what is needed

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Can you help me with my project?"
"I'm working on a VB.NET application where I need to implement a login form for doctors. Can you help me with the code to validate user credentials and display a message if the login fails?"
